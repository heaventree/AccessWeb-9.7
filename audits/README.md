# ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 Audit Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive audit of the ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 platform, focusing on security and accessibility compliance. The goal of this audit is to identify areas for improvement and provide a structured remediation plan to achieve a target accessibility score of 95/100.

## Current Status

- **Current Accessibility Score**: 72/100
- **Target Accessibility Score**: 95/100
- **Security Compliance**: Moderate (requires targeted improvements)
- **Remediation Progress**: 0% (Plan established, implementation pending)

## Documents

### 1. [Security and Accessibility Audit Report](./SECURITY_ACCESSIBILITY_AUDIT.md)

A comprehensive analysis of the current state of the ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 platform, identifying:

- Security strengths and vulnerabilities
- Accessibility compliance and gaps
- Technical implementation details
- Compliance status with industry standards

### 2. [Remediation Roadmap](./REMEDIATION_ROADMAP.md)

A detailed, phased approach to addressing the identified issues, including:

- Prioritized action items
- Code examples and implementation guidance
- Timeline and effort estimates
- Expected accessibility score improvements

## Key Findings Summary

### Security

- **Strengths**: Strong CSP implementation, JWT authentication with key rotation, secure storage mechanisms
- **Areas for Improvement**: CSRF protection, input validation, security headers, dependency management

### Accessibility

- **Strengths**: Semantic structure, keyboard navigation fundamentals, color contrast considerations
- **Areas for Improvement**: ARIA implementation, keyboard trap resolution, form accessibility, image alternatives

## Remediation Timeline

The remediation plan is structured in four phases over an 8-week period:

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Critical security & high-impact accessibility fixes (Score: 72 → 80)
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Functional and visual accessibility improvements (Score: 80 → 88)
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Security hardening and compliance finalization (Score: 88 → 95)
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Performance optimization and final polish (Score: 95 → 97+)

## Next Steps

1. Review the audit report and roadmap
2. Secure approval for the remediation plan
3. Prioritize Phase 1 tasks for immediate implementation
4. Establish regular progress tracking and reporting mechanism
