## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Security First:** All implementations must follow security best practices
- **Accessibility Compliance:** All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Type Safety:** Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase
- **Non-destructive Changes:** Make incremental improvements without breaking existing functionality
- **Documentation:** Document all key decisions and implementations

### Coding Patterns
- **Error Handling:** Use the centralized error handler for consistent error management
- **State Management:** Use React Query for remote state, context for global state
- **Component Structure:** Follow a functional component approach with hooks
- **Security:** Use security utilities for authentication, sanitization, and protection
- **API Communication:** Use the apiClient for all API requests

### Critical Project Guidelines

**Non-Destructive Development**  
- Never delete or replace existing functional code  
- Build incrementally on top of existing work  
- Use feature toggles for major changes  
- Always maintain backward compatibility  

**Security-First Approach**  
- All user inputs must be sanitized  
- Use secure storage for sensitive data  
- Implement proper authentication and authorization  
- Follow content security policy best practices  
- Rate limit all API endpoints  

**Accessibility Requirements**  
- All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards  
- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)  
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout  
- Maintain proper contrast ratios  
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content  

**Code Organization**  
- Follow the established directory structure  
- Use common/security/accessibility utility directories  
- Implement proper TypeScript typing  
- Document all public functions and components  
- Follow the error handling pattern with errorHandler.ts  

**Performance Considerations**  
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting  
- Implement proper memoization for expensive operations  
- Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately  
- Limit re-renders with proper component design  
- Implement progressive loading for large data sets

- Refactored utility files into organized directories (common, security, accessibility, api)  
- Created index.ts files in each directory for easier imports  
- Consolidated duplicate utility files to eliminate redundancy  
- Fixed import paths across the application to use the new directory structure

- Fixed the testAccessibility function in the WCAG Checker page  

**Outstanding Issues:**  
- Some TypeScript errors remain in utility files (tracked in LSP_ISSUES.md)  
- Import path issues in some files (notably passwordPolicy.ts import in authApi.ts)  
- Error handling parameter count mismatches in some utilities  
- React-Helmet warnings still present in some components  

**Next Steps:**  
- Continue addressing the issues tracked in LSP_ISSUES.md

**The project has made significant progress in improving code organization and accessibility features. The reorganized directory structure provides better maintainability, while the new accessibility components create a solid foundation for improving the accessibility score toward the 95/100 target. The next agent should focus on implementing the items in ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md, particularly the keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes, as these will have the most significant impact on the accessibility score.**

Progress Summary
Worked on improving the WCAG Color Palette Generator UI layout.
Attempted to implement a more compact layout for the controls above the generated palette.
Fixed the shuffle function to properly respect locked colors while shuffling unlocked ones.
Started consolidating controls into a single toolbar container as per user request.
Implementation Details
Attempted to modify the UI to match the provided screenshot with all tools in a single container.
Worked on removing duplicated shuffle and export buttons that appeared in multiple sections.
Focused on creating a cleaner, more space-efficient layout with the controls properly aligned.
Challenges Encountered
Had difficulty with scoping changes correctly due to the large component file size.
The replacement approach created unexpected UI issues that required rolling back.
Need more targeted, incremental changes to avoid disrupting the existing functionality.
Next Steps for Future Work
Continue consolidating the controls into a single container above the generated palette
Specifically target the layout to match the provided screenshot with:
Color picker and hex input on the left
Generate/shuffle buttons in the center
Export buttons with PRO tags on the right
Harmony buttons should be arranged in a neat row below these controls
Ensure the dark mode toggle remains accessible but doesn't duplicate functionality
Test thoroughly after each incremental change to prevent regressions
Note: Future work should take a more incremental approach with smaller, targeted changes to the layout rather than attempting to replace large sections of the component at once.
