**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Assessment Director  

## Overview

This document outlines the governance framework for assessing the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool project. It defines the roles, responsibilities, processes, and standards for conducting objective assessments of the system's quality, compliance, and overall effectiveness.

## Assessment Principles

The assessment process is guided by the following principles:

1. **Objectivity:** Assessments must be based on empirical evidence and measurable criteria
2. **Transparency:** Assessment methods, criteria, and results must be transparent to all stakeholders
3. **Consistency:** A consistent assessment methodology must be applied across all assessment areas
4. **Independence:** Assessors must maintain independence from the implementation teams
5. **Evidence-Based:** All findings must be supported by documented evidence
6. **Actionable:** Recommendations must be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound
7. **Continuous Improvement:** The assessment process itself must be continuously evaluated and improved
