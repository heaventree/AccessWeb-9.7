# Accessibility Self-Assessment Framework

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** Initial Draft  
**Owner:** Accessibility Assessment Team  

## Overview

This document outlines the framework for conducting self-assessments of the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool against accessibility standards. As a tool designed to help others achieve accessibility compliance, it is essential that the tool itself meets or exceeds the accessibility standards it promotes.

## Assessment Principles

The accessibility self-assessment is guided by the following principles:

1. **Eating Our Own Dog Food** - Using our own tool to assess its accessibility
2. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Assessing all components and user journeys
3. **Regular Assessment** - Conducting assessments on a regular schedule
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Using assessment results to drive improvements
5. **Transparent Reporting** - Openly reporting assessment results
6. **User-Centered** - Focusing on real user accessibility needs

## Assessment Scope

The accessibility self-assessment covers the following areas:

1. **User Interface Components** - All UI components used in the application
2. **User Journeys** - Complete user flows through the application
3. **Content** - All content including text, images, and media
4. **Documentation** - User documentation and help materials
5. **Development Process** - The process for ensuring accessibility during development

## Accessibility Standards

The assessment is conducted against the following standards:

1. **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** - Primary compliance target
2. **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** - Target for newer components
3. **WAI-ARIA 1.2** - For rich internet applications
4. **Section 508** - For U.S. government compliance

## Assessment Methodology

### 1. Automated Testing

The assessment includes automated testing using:

- **Axe Core** - For automated accessibility testing
- **Lighthouse** - For broader accessibility checks
- **WAVE** - For alternative automated perspective
- **HTML Validators** - For markup validation
- **Custom Test Scripts** - For application-specific checks

### 2. Manual Testing

Manual testing is conducted by:

- **Accessibility Experts** - Using assessment checklists
- **Developers** - Conducting component-level reviews
- **Users with Disabilities** - Providing real-world feedback
- **Third-Party Reviewers** - For independent verification

### 3. Assistive Technology Testing

Testing is conducted with the following assistive technologies:

- **Screen Readers** - NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
