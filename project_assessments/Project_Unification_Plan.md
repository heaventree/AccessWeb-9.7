# Project Unification Plan

**Project:** ACCESS-WEB-V9.7  
**Date:** April 19, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for unifying multiple repositories into a single, cohesive codebase under ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 as the source of truth. The goal is to eliminate code duplication, establish clear ownership, and create a standardized structure for future development.

## Repositories

1. **ACCESS-WEB-V9.7** - Designated as the single source of truth for the project
2. ~~**WCAG9.4-audit**~~ - Archived (disaster recovery backup)
3. ~~**WCAG9.4-audit-backup**~~ - Archived (disaster recovery backup)

> Note: Backup repositories have been moved to an archive directory and should not be used for active development.

## Unification Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)

1. ✅ Establish ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 as the single source of truth
2. ✅ Create CODEOWNERS file to establish clear ownership
3. ✅ Create component mapping document
4. ✅ Create standardization templates for components and utilities
5. ✅ Archive backup repositories (WCAG9.4-audit and WCAG9.4-audit-backup)

### Phase 2: Directory Structure Reorganization (In Progress)

1. ⬜ Organize components following standardization template
   - Group by functionality (accessibility, admin, auth, etc.)
   - Apply consistent folder structure
   - Update imports and references

2. ⬜ Organize utilities following standardization template
   - Group by domain (accessibility, api, auth, common, etc.)
   - Apply consistent structure
   - Update imports and references

3. ⬜ Standardize configuration files
   - Ensure consistent formatting and options
   - Update to latest versions
   - Document configuration decisions

### Phase 3: Code Quality and Testing

1. ⬜ Implement ESLint rules for consistent code style
2. ⬜ Add Prettier configuration for automatic formatting
3. ⬜ Create unit tests for critical components
4. ⬜ Set up continuous integration
5. ⬜ Implement accessibility testing automation

### Phase 4: Documentation

1. ⬜ Create comprehensive README
2. ⬜ Document architecture decisions
3. ⬜ Create API documentation
4. ⬜ Update component documentation
5. ⬜ Create development guides

## Implementation Approach

### Directory Structure

The project will follow this standard structure:

```
ACCESS-WEB-V9.7/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # UI components grouped by functionality
│   │   ├── accessibility/
│   │   ├── admin/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   └── ui/
│   ├── pages/            # Page components
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions grouped by domain
│   │   ├── accessibility/
│   │   ├── api/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   └── common/
│   ├── services/         # External service integrations
│   ├── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
│   ├── context/          # React context providers
│   ├── assets/           # Static assets
│   └── styles/           # Global styles and themes
├── public/               # Public assets
├── scripts/              # Build and development scripts
├── docs/                 # Documentation
└── tests/                # Test files and fixtures
```

### Standardization Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**
   - Each component in its own directory
   - index.tsx for main export
   - Component-specific types, styles, and utilities in separate files
   - Comprehensive documentation and tests

2. **Utility Functions**
   - Group related utilities by domain
   - Proper error handling and type definitions
   - Unit tests for all utilities
   - Documentation with usage examples

3. **Coding Standards**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Functional components with hooks
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive error handling

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks

1. **Functionality Loss**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive testing before and after changes
   - Backup strategy in place (archived repositories)

2. **Import Path Changes**
   - Mitigation: Systematic updates to import paths
   - Automated tests to catch broken imports

3. **Regression Bugs**
   - Mitigation: Incremental changes with testing
   - Bug tracking and prioritization

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Complete Phase 1 (Foundation) ✅
- **Week 3-4**: Complete Phase 2 (Directory Structure Reorganization)
- **Week 5-6**: Complete Phase 3 (Code Quality and Testing)
- **Week 7-8**: Complete Phase 4 (Documentation)

## Success Criteria

1. Single repository containing all code (ACCESS-WEB-V9.7)
2. Consistent directory structure following standards
3. All tests passing
4. Documentation complete and up-to-date
5. No duplicate code or components
6. Clear ownership of all components and utilities
