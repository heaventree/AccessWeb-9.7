# Remediation Strategy: Quick Reference Guide

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** Immediate Action Required  

## Critical Issues Summary

1. Documentation does not accurately reflect implementation
2. Security architecture is inadequately defined
3. Application's own accessibility compliance is unverified
4. Data architecture and models are largely undocumented
5. Testing infrastructure is insufficient
6. Technical decisions lack documentation
7. Risk management framework is missing
8. Documentation structure is overly complex

## Top Priority Actions

### Immediate (Week 1)

1. **Documentation Restructuring**
   - Reduce folder nesting to maximum 2-3 levels
   - Create flat "essential documents" directory
   - Implement user-centered organization

2. **Implementation Verification**
   - Inventory all documented components
   - Map components to source code files
   - Identify components without implementation

### Short-term (Weeks 2-4)

3. **Security Architecture**
   - Document authentication and authorization
   - Define data protection standards
   - Establish API security protocols

4. **Accessibility Self-Compliance**
   - Define target WCAG compliance level
   - Audit all UI components
   - Implement automated accessibility testing

### Medium-term (Weeks 5-8)

5. **Data Architecture Documentation**
   - Document data models and schemas
   - Define state management patterns
   - Create data flow diagrams

6. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Establish comprehensive testing framework
   - Implement automated testing
   - Create test coverage reporting

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Documentation Accuracy | 35% | >95% |
| Security Documentation | 24% | 100% |
| WCAG Self-Compliance | Unknown | AA |
| Data Model Documentation | 15% | 100% |
| Test Coverage | Unknown | >80% |
| ADR Completion | 0% | 100% |
| Risk Documentation | 10% | 100% |
| Documentation Structure | Complex | 2-3 levels |

## Daily Stand-up Questions

1. What documentation/implementation gaps did you identify yesterday?
2. What verification or remediation work are you doing today?
3. What obstacles are blocking your progress?

## Weekly Review Checklist

- [ ] Verify all planned tasks for the week were completed
- [ ] Update traceability matrix with new implementation verifications
- [ ] Review any newly identified gaps or risks
- [ ] Adjust priorities for the following week if needed
- [ ] Update progress metrics dashboard
