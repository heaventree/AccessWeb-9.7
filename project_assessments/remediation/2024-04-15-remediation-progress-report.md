## Challenges and Risks

1. **Documentation-Implementation Gap**
   - The gap between documented and implemented components is larger than initially estimated
   - Mitigation: Accelerating verification process and prioritizing critical components

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Limited resources for simultaneous work on multiple streams
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with focus on critical items first

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Significant technical debt in accessibility implementation
   - Mitigation: Prioritizing critical WCAG compliance issues first

## Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Accessibility Implementation**
   - Implement missing critical accessibility components (FocusTrap, LiveRegion, SkipLink)
   - Complete keyboard accessibility improvements
   - Enhance screen reader support

2. **Enhance Documentation Process**
   - Implement inline documentation requirements
   - Create automated documentation extraction
   - Establish documentation quality gates

3. **Improve Verification Automation**
   - Expand automated verification scripts
   - Integrate verification into CI/CD pipeline
   - Create verification dashboards

## Next Steps

1. Continue accessibility compliance implementation
2. Expand component verification to all categories
3. Begin security architecture implementation
4. Implement testing infrastructure improvements
5. Accelerate documentation creation for critical components

## Conclusion

The remediation effort is making steady progress with significant achievements in addressing critical accessibility issues and implementing the verification framework. While challenges remain, particularly in the documentation-implementation gap, the team is focused on addressing the most critical issues first and establishing sustainable processes for long-term improvement.

The next phase will focus on expanding verification coverage, implementing missing critical components, and enhancing the security architecture.
