## Progress Tracking

### Work Stream Completion Rates

| Work Stream | Initial % | Current % | Target % | Progress |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Documentation Restructuring | 20% | 40% | 100% | +20% |
| Implementation Verification | 15% | 45% | 100% | +30% |
| Security Architecture | 10% | 35% | 100% | +25% |
| Self-Compliance Testing | 25% | 35% | 100% | +10% |
| Data/State Design | 15% | 20% | 100% | +5% |
| Accountability Assignments | 10% | 15% | 100% | +5% |
| Testing Infrastructure | 5% | 10% | 100% | +5% |
| Technical Decision Records | 5% | 10% | 100% | +5% |
| **Overall** | 13% | 26% | 100% | +13% |

### Critical Path Items

The following items are on the critical path and must be completed on schedule to avoid delays:

1. ‚úÖ Secure JWT authentication implementation
2. üîÑ Server-side JWT middleware implementation
3. ‚è≥ Data encryption implementation
4. ‚è≥ Data persistence layer
5. ‚è≥ Automated testing pipeline

## Risk Management

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Resource constraints | Medium | High | Prioritize critical security and accessibility items first |
| Technology compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Create proof-of-concepts before full implementation |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Strictly adhere to defined remediation tasks |
| Knowledge gaps | Medium | High | Provide documentation and training for team members |
| Integration challenges | Medium | High | Implement incremental changes with thorough testing |

## Updates and Revisions

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|
| April 15, 2024 | 1.0 | Initial timeline creation | Project Management Team |
| April 15, 2024 | 1.1 | Updated to reflect security architecture progress | Security Team |

## Conclusion

The remediation timeline provides a structured approach to addressing the audit findings. The project has made significant progress in security architecture and implementation verification, with 26% of the overall remediation complete. Key security components have been implemented, with focus now shifting to server-side security and data protection.

The timeline will be reviewed and updated weekly to reflect progress and any adjustments to priorities or schedules. All team members are responsible for reporting progress and challenges to ensure the timeline remains accurate and achievable.
