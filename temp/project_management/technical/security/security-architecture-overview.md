# Security Architecture Overview

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** Initial Draft  
**Owner:** Security Architecture Team  

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security architecture for the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool. It outlines the security principles, components, controls, and implementation details that ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

## Security Principles

The security architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to protect the system
2. **Least Privilege** - Users and components are granted the minimum access necessary to perform their functions
3. **Secure by Design** - Security is integrated into the design process from the beginning
4. **Zero Trust** - All requests are authenticated and authorized regardless of source
5. **Open Design** - Security does not depend on obscurity of implementation
6. **Fail Secure** - System defaults to secure state when failures occur

## Security Architecture Components

### 1. Authentication Framework

The authentication framework provides user identity verification through:

#### 1.1 Authentication Methods

- **JWT-based Authentication** - JSON Web Tokens for stateless authentication
- **Session-based Authentication** - Server-side session management (alternative for specific use cases)
- **OAuth 2.0 Integration** - Support for third-party authentication providers (planned)
- **Multi-factor Authentication** - Optional second factor for enhanced security (planned)

#### 1.2 Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials via login form
2. Server validates credentials against stored hashed passwords
3. Upon successful validation, JWT token is generated with user identity and roles
4. Token is returned to client and stored in secure, HttpOnly cookie
5. Subsequent requests include the token for authentication
6. Token is validated on each request
7. Token expires after configured timeout period
8. Refresh token mechanism allows session extension without re-authentication

#### 1.3 Password Management

- Passwords stored using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Password change and recovery workflows implemented
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

#### 1.4 Implementation Details

**Core Components:**
- `AuthProvider` - React context provider for authentication state
- `LoginForm` - User login component
- `AuthService` - Backend service for authentication operations
- `JWTMiddleware` - Middleware for JWT validation

**Key Files:**
- `WCAG9.4-audit/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Authentication context provider
- `WCAG9.4-audit/src/services/AuthService.ts` - Authentication service implementation
- `WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Login form component
- `WCAG9.4-audit/src/middleware/jwt.middleware.ts` - JWT validation middleware

### 2. Authorization Framework

The authorization framework controls access to resources through:

#### 2.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles:**
  - `Admin` - Full system access
  - `Auditor` - Access to create and manage audits
  - `Reporter` - Access to view reports
  - `Guest` - Access to public resources only

- **Permission Structure:**
  - Resource-based permissions (e.g., audit:create, report:view)
  - Operations per resource (create, read, update, delete)
  - Role-permission mappings defined in configuration

#### 2.2 Authorization Flow

1. User authenticates and receives JWT with embedded roles
2. Each protected resource/route defines required roles or permissions
3. Authorization checks are performed on both client and server
4. Client-side checks control UI rendering for better UX
5. Server-side checks enforce security regardless of client-side state
6. Failed authorization results in appropriate error responses (403 Forbidden)

#### 2.3 Implementation Details

**Core Components:**
- `PermissionCheck` - Component for permission-based UI rendering
- `PrivateRoute` - Route guard for protected routes
- `RoleBasedAccess` - Component for role-based UI rendering
