# Documentation Consolidation Plan

**Current Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for consolidating all project documentation for the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool into a centralized, well-organized structure. The goal is to create a single source of truth that is intuitive to navigate while preserving historical information.

## Current Documentation State

Documentation is currently scattered across several locations:

1. **GUIDES/** - Core documentation on project architecture and technical standards
2. **HANDOVERS/** - Implementation guides and milestone reports
3. **WCAG9.4-audit/** - Specific feature documentation and roadmaps
4. Various markdown files in the root directory

Issues with the current approach include:

- Duplication of information
- Inconsistent formatting and structure
- Difficult to find specific documentation
- References to outdated project names (e.g., previous project references)
- Lack of clear versioning and document status

## Consolidation Strategy

### 1. Central Repository Creation

Create a structured `project_management/` directory with specialized subfolders:

```
project_management/
├── archive/                 # Archived original documentation
├── assessments/             # Project assessments and audits
├── change_management/       # Change request process
├── communication/           # Communication plans and templates
├── governance/              # Project governance
├── implementation/          # Implementation guides
├── improvement/             # Process improvements
├── onboarding/              # Onboarding documentation
├── planning/                # Project planning
├── quality/                 # Quality assurance
├── requirements/            # Project requirements
├── risk_management/         # Risk assessment and mitigation
├── technical/               # Technical documentation
└── updates/                 # Project updates
```

### 2. Document Migration Process

For each document being migrated:

1. **Review & Update**:
   - Update references to previous project names (replace with "WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool")
   - Standardize formatting and structure
   - Update technical information to reflect current implementation
   - Add version tracking and last-updated dates

2. **Categorize & Place**:
   - Determine the most appropriate location based on document type
   - Create logical subfolder structure within major categories
   - Use consistent file naming conventions

3. **Cross-Reference**:
   - Add references to related documents
   - Update links to point to new document locations

4. **Archive Original**:
   - Preserve original documents in archive folder
   - Create redirection notices in original locations

### 3. Priority Document Migration

Documents will be migrated in the following priority order:

1. **High Priority (Immediate)**
   - Core architecture documentation
   - API specifications
   - Implementation guides for active features
   - Current milestone reports

2. **Medium Priority (Within 2 Weeks)**
   - Technical standards and guidelines
   - Development processes
   - Testing procedures
   - Deployment guides

3. **Lower Priority (Within 1 Month)**
   - Historical documents
   - Outdated specifications for reference
   - Early-stage planning documents

### 4. Document Structure Standardization

All migrated documents will follow a standardized structure:

```markdown
# Document Title

**Current Version:** X.Y.Z  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** [Draft|In Review|Approved|Production|Archived]

## Related Documents

- [Document Name](./path/to/document.md) - Brief description
- [Another Document](./path/to/another.md) - Brief description

## Document History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| 1.0.0   | YYYY-MM-DD | Name | Initial version |
| 1.1.0   | YYYY-MM-DD | Name | Added X feature |
```

### 5. Navigation & Discovery Improvements

To improve document discovery:

1. **Master Index Creation**:
   - Create comprehensive `MASTER_INDEX.md` with links to all documents
   - Organize by category and document type
   - Include brief descriptions

2. **README Updates**:
   - Update all folder-level README.md files
   - Provide context and navigation guidance

3. **Redirection System**:
   - Add README.md files in original document locations
   - Point users to new locations

### 6. Document Maintenance Process

Establish ongoing maintenance procedures:

1. **Version Control**:
   - Follow semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
   - Update the "Last Updated" date on every change
   - Maintain change history section

2. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Schedule monthly documentation reviews
   - Verify accuracy and currency of information
   - Update technical details as implementation changes

3. **New Document Guidelines**:
   - Provide template for new documentation
   - Define approval process for new documents
   - Establish naming conventions

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Deliverables |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 1. Setup | Days 1-2 | Create folder structure, templates, and guidelines |
| 2. High Priority Migration | Days 3-5 | Migrate and update core documentation |
| 3. Medium Priority Migration | Days 6-14 | Migrate and update technical guides |
| 4. Low Priority Migration | Days 15-30 | Complete remaining document migration |
| 5. Final Review | Days 31-35 | Comprehensive review and final adjustments |
| 6. Team Training | Day 36 | Team briefing on new documentation system |

## Success Criteria

The consolidation will be considered successful when:

1. All documentation is migrated to the appropriate locations
2. All references to previous project names are updated
3. All documents follow the standardized format
4. Navigation system (indexes, READMEs) is complete
5. Team members can easily locate relevant documentation
6. Redirection notices are in place for all original locations

## Current Progress

| Category | Total Docs | Migrated | % Complete |

| Architecture | 8 | 3 | 37.5% |
| Guides | 15 | 1 | 6.7% |
| Specifications | 5 | 2 | 40% |
| Milestones | 3 | 2 | 66.7% |
| Integrations | 2 | 1 | 50% |
| Overall | 33 | 9 | 27.3% |

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration of remaining high-priority documents
2. Update cross-references between documents
3. Create additional directory-level README files
4. Implement document review schedule
5. Create document maintenance guidelines
