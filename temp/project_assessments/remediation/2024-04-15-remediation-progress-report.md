## Challenges and Risks

1. **Documentation-Implementation Gap**
   - The gap between documented and implemented components is larger than initially estimated
   - Mitigation: Accelerating verification process and prioritizing critical components

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Limited resources for simultaneous work on multiple streams
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with focus on critical items first

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Significant technical debt in accessibility implementation
   - Mitigation: Prioritizing critical WCAG compliance issues first

## Recommendations

1. **Accelerate Accessibility Implementation**
   - Implement missing critical accessibility components (FocusTrap, LiveRegion, SkipLink)
   - Complete keyboard accessibility improvements
   - Enhance screen reader support

2. **Enhance Documentation Process**
   - Implement inline documentation requirements
   - Create automated documentation extraction
   - Establish documentation quality gates

3. **Improve Verification Automation**
   - Expand automated verification scripts
   - Integrate verification into CI/CD pipeline
   - Create verification dashboards

## Next Steps

1. Continue accessibility compliance implementation
2. Address remaining TypeScript errors in code
3. Fix Helmet/HelmetProvider implementation
4. Complete error handler implementation
5. Accelerate documentation creation for critical components

## Conclusion

The remediation effort is making substantial progress with significant achievements in addressing critical security issues, implementing robust error handling, and enhancing accessibility compliance. The security architecture has seen major improvements with the implementation of JWT key rotation, CSRF protection, content security policies, data sanitization, and rate limiting.

While challenges remain, particularly in the documentation-implementation gap and remaining TypeScript errors, the team is focused on addressing these issues systematically, prioritizing critical components and establishing sustainable processes for long-term improvement.

The next phase will focus on continued improvements to error handling, fixing remaining TypeScript errors, completing the Helmet implementation, and further enhancing the security architecture. The current trajectory indicates we are on track to meet or exceed the target score of 95/100.
