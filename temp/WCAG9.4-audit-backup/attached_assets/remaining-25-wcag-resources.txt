### 26. Cognitive Accessibility: Simplifying Content  
**Why It Matters**:  
Users with cognitive disabilities benefit from clear, simple language and predictable layouts.  

**Techniques**:  
- Use plain language (avoid jargon).  
- Ensure consistent navigation and layout.  
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps.  
- Use visuals to support text content.  
- Allow users to control timing and interruptions.

---

### 27. Focus Management for Screen Reader Users
**Importance**: Proper focus management is essential for screen reader users to navigate and interact with web content effectively.

**Best Practices**:
- Use proper tabindex values (avoid positive values when possible).
- Manage focus when content changes dynamically.
- Use focus indicators that are visible and meet contrast requirements.
- Implement keyboard focus order that follows logical document flow.
- Restore focus to appropriate elements after modal dialogs close.

---

### 28. ARIA Landmarks and Document Structure  
**What Are Landmarks?**: ARIA landmarks are HTML attributes that identify regions of a page, making it easier for assistive technology users to navigate content.  

**Key Landmarks**:  
- `banner`: Site header content
- `navigation`: Primary navigation links
- `main`: The main content area
- `complementary`: Supporting content
- `contentinfo`: Footer information
- `search`: Search functionality
- `form`: Input forms requiring user interaction
- `region`: Distinct section requiring a label

---

### 29. Accessible Navigation Patterns  
**Core Requirements**:  
- Ensure all navigation is keyboard accessible.

- Provide multiple ways to find content (search, sitemap, etc.).

**Common Patterns**:  
- Horizontal navigation bars
- Vertical menus
- Dropdown/flyout menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Pagination
- Navigation drawers/hamburger menus

---

### 30. Creating Accessible SVGs  
**Benefits of SVG**:

### 34. Accessible Data Tables
**Structural Elements**:
- Use `<caption>` to provide a title for the table
- Use `<th>` for header cells and `<td>` for data cells
- Use `scope` attributes on header cells
- Include `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<tfoot>` for complex tables

**Additional Techniques**:
- Add `summary` attribute for complex tables (HTML4) or descriptive text for HTML5
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate descriptions with tables
- Consider responsive design techniques for mobile viewing
- Avoid merged cells when possible

---

### 35. Accessible PDF Documents
**Key Requirements**:
