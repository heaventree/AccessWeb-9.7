# WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool - Detailed Handover Document

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Project:** WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool  
**Status:** In Development  
**Author:** Development Team  

## Project Overview

The WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool is a web-based application built to help developers and content creators evaluate and improve the accessibility of their websites according to WCAG 2.2 standards. Following a comprehensive audit (scoring 35/100), the project is undergoing significant restructuring and improvement across multiple areas, with a focus on aligning documentation with implementation and enhancing security architecture.

### Project Goals

1. Create a reliable, secure, and accessible tool for WCAG compliance testing
2. Bridge the gap between documentation and implementation
3. Establish a robust security architecture
4. Ensure the tool itself meets WCAG compliance standards
5. Create a comprehensive testing infrastructure
6. Document technical decisions and architecture

## Current State

The project is approximately 26% through the remediation process, with significant progress in security architecture implementation (35% complete) and implementation verification (45% complete). The application has a functional frontend built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with ongoing improvements to security, accessibility, and documentation.

### Key Components

The application consists of several core components:

1. **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with secure password handling
2. **Authorization Framework**: Role and permission-based access control
3. **Accessibility Testing Engine**: Core component for scanning and analyzing websites
4. **Reporting System**: Generates detailed accessibility reports
5. **User Dashboard**: Manages projects, reports, and settings
6. **Resource Library**: WCAG guidelines, best practices, and implementation examples

### Recent Accomplishments

1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implemented secure JWT authentication using jose library
   - Created password utilities with bcrypt for secure password handling
   - Implemented role-based and permission-based authorization components
   - Created PrivateRoute component for route protection

2. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Updated master index to include new security documents
   - Created security architecture progress documentation
   - Created verification reports for security implementation
   - Added security audit update documentation

3. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Fixed keyboard trap in Modal component (WCAG 2.1.2)
   - Improved screen reader access in ResultsSummary and IssuesList (WCAG 4.1.2)
   - Added live regions for dynamic content updates

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The application follows a modern React-based architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build system
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
3. **State Management**: Combined approach with React Context and React Query
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based using jose library
5. **API Communication**: Fetch API with custom error handling
6. **Routing**: React Router v6 with protected routes

### Security Implementation

The security system has been significantly improved with the following key implementations:

1. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Replaced insecure base64 encoding with proper JWT implementation
   - Uses jose library for browser-compatible JWT handling
   - Implements token signing, verification, and expiration

2. **Password Security**:
   - bcrypt-based password hashing with appropriate salt rounds
   - Password strength validation
   - Secure password verification

3. **Authorization System**:
   - Role-based access control with hierarchical roles
   - Permission-based access control for granular permissions
   - Protected routes to secure sensitive application areas

## Current Work Streams

The project is currently organized into eight work streams, each with specific objectives and timelines:

1. **Documentation Restructuring** (40% complete): Simplifying and standardizing documentation
2. **Implementation Verification** (45% complete): Ensuring alignment between documentation and code
3. **Security Architecture** (35% complete): Building robust security framework
4. **Self-Compliance Testing** (35% complete): Ensuring the tool meets WCAG standards
5. **Data/State Design** (20% complete): Documenting and improving data architecture
6. **Accountability Assignments** (15% complete): Establishing ownership and responsibilities
7. **Testing Infrastructure** (10% complete): Building comprehensive testing framework
8. **Technical Decision Records** (10% complete): Documenting key technical decisions

## Next Priorities

## Appendix B: Key Implementation Examples

### Authentication

```typescript
// JWT token generation using jose
export const generateToken = async (
  payload: JWTPayload,
  expiresIn: string = '1h'
): Promise<string> => {
  const secret = new TextEncoder().encode(getSecret());
  return new jose.SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
    .setIssuedAt()
    .setExpirationTime(expiresIn)
    .sign(secret);
};
```

### Authorization

```typescript
// Role-based access component
export const RoleBasedAccess: React.FC<RoleBasedAccessProps> = ({
  requiredRole,
  children,
  fallback = null
}) => {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  
  if (!user) return fallback;
  
  const hasRequiredRole = checkRoleAccess(user.role, requiredRole);
  
  return hasRequiredRole ? <>{children}</> : fallback;
};
```

### Route Protection

```typescript
// Protected route component
export const PrivateRoute: React.FC<PrivateRouteProps> = ({ 
  children,
  roleRequired 
}) => {
  const { isAuthenticated, isLoading, user } = useAuth();
  const location = useLocation();
  
  if (isLoading) {
    return <LoadingScreen />;
  }
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    return <Navigate to="/login" state={{ from: location }} replace />;
  }
  
  if (roleRequired && user?.role) {
    const hasRequiredRole = checkRoleAccess(user.role, roleRequired);
    if (!hasRequiredRole) {
      return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" replace />;
    }
  }
  
  return <>{children}</>;
};
```
