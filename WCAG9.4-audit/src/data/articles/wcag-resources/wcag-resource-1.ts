  "content": "# Introduction to Web Accessibility (What is A11y?)\n\n**Definition**: Web accessibility (often abbreviated as A11y - \"a\" followed by 11 letters then \"y\") means designing and developing websites, tools, and technologies so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web, and they can contribute to the Web.\n\n**Importance**: Accessibility ensures equal access and opportunity for people with diverse abilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. It also benefits people *without* disabilities, such as older people with changing abilities due to aging, people with temporary disabilities (like a broken arm), those with situational limitations (like bright sunlight or a noisy environment), or users with slow internet connections.\n\n**Scope**: It encompasses all disabilities affecting access to the Web, including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual impairments.",
