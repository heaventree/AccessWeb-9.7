## Technical Debt Management

- [x] Fix LSP warnings in WCAGStandardsTable.tsx and WCAGRequirementsTable.tsx
- [ ] Address LSP issues in useAuth.ts
- [ ] Fix type errors in accessibilityTester.ts
- [ ] Remove unused imports in component files
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add proper documentation for all major functions
- [ ] Set up automated testing for core functionality

## Next Priority Tasks

1. **Authentication System Disabling**: 
   - Disable authentication completely during development to allow unrestricted access
   - Review the `useAuth.ts` hook to add a "dev mode" option that bypasses all authentication checks
   - Add clear visual indicator when running in dev mode with authentication disabled
   - Document how to toggle between auth and no-auth modes for development

2. **WCAG 2.2 Data Implementation**:
   - Complete the addition of WCAG 2.2 success criteria to the wcag-requirements-master.ts data
   - Ensure proper categorization and conformance levels for all new criteria
   - Add appropriate disability tags and metadata for filtering
   - Cross-reference with official W3C documentation for accuracy

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all components
   - Add proper fallback UI for error states
   - Create a centralized error reporting system
   - Improve error messages to be more user-friendly and actionable

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Conduct an audit of the application with its own testing tools
   - Fix any identified accessibility issues
   - Add keyboard navigation support where missing
   - Enhance focus management throughout the application
   - Implement ARIA attributes where appropriate

5. **Filter Enhancement**:
   - Add filter count indicator showing number of active filters
   - Implement per-column filtering in tables
   - Add filter persistence across page refreshes using localStorage
   - Create preset filters for common use cases

## Notes for Developers

- Authentication should remain disabled during development to allow unrestricted access
- Focus on incremental changes with small, well-tested improvements
- WCAG functionality is the primary purpose and should be prioritized
- Implement changes with backward compatibility in mind
- Document all changes thoroughly for knowledge transfer
- Always add new suggestions to this roadmap document

## Knowledge Base Insights

Based on the accessibility resources we've compiled, here are key areas to consider for future development:

1. **Document Accessibility**:
   - Add support for PDF accessibility testing and remediation
   - Implement document structure analysis for Word, PDF, and other document formats
   - Create document accessibility checklists and repair tools

2. **Media Accessibility**:
   - Add support for video caption validation
   - Implement audio description testing
   - Create tools for analyzing media player accessibility

3. **Mobile Accessibility**:
   - Extend testing capabilities to mobile interfaces
   - Implement specific checks for touch targets, gestures, and orientation
   - Create mobile-specific guidelines and checklists

4. **Regional Compliance**:
   - Expand support for region-specific standards beyond WCAG
   - Add EAA compliance checking
   - Implement UK-specific accessibility regulations

5. **Accessibility Tools**:
   - Add an accessibility statement generator
   - Implement automated remediation suggestions
   - Create exportable reports for compliance documentation

These insights are collected from multiple authoritative sources on accessibility best practices and should inform our future development priorities.
