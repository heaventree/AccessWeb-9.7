Initial checkpoint
Thanks for starting to provide the articles content. I see this is part 1 of the WCAG accessibility resources (articles 26-50). It looks like there's still one more line remaining in the file. Let me continue examining the available files to get a better understanding of the content you're sharing.
 
 
Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Ah-okay-that-explains-the-limitations-and-why-the-links-aren-t-working-as-expected-on-your-end-Th-1743621098689.txt
I see that you're providing articles related to WCAG accessibility guidelines. Let me check if there are more files to understand the full content you're sharing.
 
 
Opened . directory
Let me also check if there are more articles in the attached_assets directory:
 
 
Opened attached_assets directory
Let me also look at the GUIDES directory, specifically the accessibility compliance guide, to understand what we might need to incorporate:
 
 
Opened GUIDES/16_Accessibility_Compliance.md
Let me also check the current state of the project to understand what we've built so far. Let's start by looking at the main structure of the WCAG9.4-audit directory:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/ROADMAP.md
Let me check the main application files to understand the structure better:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/main.tsx
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/App.tsx
Now, let me check the package.json file to understand the dependencies we're using:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/package.json
Let's examine the website structure further by looking at one of the key components:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/AccessibilityToolbar.tsx
Let me check if there are any knowledge base files for the accessibility articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/knowledge-base.ts
Let me also check the WCAG requirements file:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/wcag-requirements-master.ts
Let me check if we have a KnowledgeBasePage component that would be a good place to add the articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/KnowledgeBasePage.tsx
Let me also check if there's any structure for articles already in the project:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/ArticlePage.tsx
Now, let me check if we have an articles data file:
 
 
Searched for "Find files related to articles or blog data in the project"
Let me check the Article type definition:
 
 
Searched for "Find article type definitions in the project"
Let me check the actual Article type definition:
 
 
Searched for "Find the Blog or Article type interface definition"
Let me check the blog type definition:
 
 
Searched for "Find the types/blog.ts file"
Let me check the types folder directly:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types directory
Now let's check the blog types:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
Based on my investigation, I understand what needs to be done. I need to create a new file for WCAG accessibility articles based on the content you provided. Let me first create a new file structure to organize these articles:

Perfect! I now have all 50 articles. Let me create a plan for implementing these articles into the project structure:
 
First, I need to create a directory structure similar to the existing articles
I'll create new article files for each of the 50 articles based on the Article type interface
I'll update the main articles index.ts file to include the new articles
I'll ensure the articles are properly organized by categories
Let me first understand how the existing WCAG articles are organized:
 
Yes, I now have all 50 articles to integrate into the knowledge base. Let me organize and implement these into the project structure.
 
Based on the content of the articles, I should categorize them properly to fit into the existing application structure. From what I've seen in the codebase, articles are organized into categories like 'wcag', 'accessibility', and 'best-practices'.
 
Let me first create a structured plan for integrating these articles:
 
Create a new directory for WCAG accessibility articles
Format each article following the Article type definition
Group articles by relevant categories
Update the articles index to include these new articles
Let me start by implementing this integration. First, I'll create a directory structure and the first batch of articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles directory
Now let me check the existing folder structure and categories:

Analysis of the 50 WCAG Accessibility Articles
After reviewing the 50 WCAG accessibility articles, here's my assessment of their quality and relevance to our web accessibility auditing platform:
 
Content Quality
Strengths:
 
Comprehensive coverage of WCAG principles, guidelines, and success criteria
Well-structured with clear headings, concise explanations, and practical examples
Technical accuracy with correct references to WCAG levels (A, AA, AAA)
Practical code examples that demonstrate implementation techniques
Updated content that includes WCAG 2.2 (released October 2023)
Depth of Content:
 
Articles range from introductory concepts (e.g., "Introduction to Web Accessibility") to advanced topics (e.g., "Testing ARIA Implementation")
Good balance between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation advice
Relevance to Our Application
These articles are highly relevant to our WCAG 9.4 audit tool for several reasons:
 
Educational Value: They provide essential knowledge that users need to understand accessibility issues our tool detects
 
Complementary to Core Functionality: While our tool automates accessibility testing, these articles help users understand:
 
Why certain issues matter
How to implement proper fixes
Best practices beyond automated testing
Coverage Alignment: The articles cover all four WCAG principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) that form the foundation of our testing approach
 
Implementation Guidance: Many articles provide code examples that users can directly apply to fix issues our tool identifies
 
Topical Organization: The articles naturally group into categories that align with our existing structure:
 
WCAG Core Principles (articles 1-11)
Technical Implementation (articles 12-25)
Advanced Topics & ARIA (articles 26-50)
Integration Recommendations
Based on this assessment, I recommend organizing these 50 articles into our existing content structure as follows:
 
WCAG Principles & Guidelines (under /wcag/ directory)
 
Articles covering core WCAG principles, success criteria, and conformance levels
Accessibility Implementation (under /best-practices/ directory)
 
Code-focused articles on implementing accessible components
Testing and validation techniques
Advanced Accessibility Topics (create new /advanced-topics/ directory)
 
ARIA-focused articles
Special use cases (authentication, SPA accessibility, etc.)
Accessibility Standards (under /accessibility-standards/ directory)
 
Updates on WCAG 2.2
Legal landscape articles
This organization will provide our users with a logical knowledge progression from basic concepts to advanced implementation techniques, all aligned with the testing capabilities of our tool.
 
Would you like me to proceed with implementing this organization and integrating the articles into our codebase?
 
We can use them either as a og or a knowledgebase

SO
 
 
I understand - we can implement these 50 articles either as blog posts or as knowledge base content. Let me examine both options to determine the best approach.
 
First, let me check the Blog and Knowledge Base structure in the codebase:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
Now let me check the Knowledge Base structure:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/knowledge-base.ts
Now let me check the structure of an example article to understand its format:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag/beginners-guide.ts
Let me examine KnowledgeBasePage:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/KnowledgeBasePage.tsx
Let me also check the BlogPage structure:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/BlogPage.tsx
Finally, let me check the ArticlePage to understand how the individual articles are displayed:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/ArticlePage.tsx
Yes, we already have a help section in place with some art8cles
 
We need to differentiate between articles dedicated to the app and these generic articles
 
3 hours ago
SO
 
 
I understand. We need to add these 50 WCAG accessibility articles while clearly differentiating them from the app-specific help articles.
 
Based on the codebase structure, I see two options for integrating these articles:
 
Option 1: Create a dedicated WCAG Knowledge Base category
We could create a new category in the existing blog system specifically for these WCAG articles:
 
Add a new category type to the Article interface:
category: 'wcag' | 'accessibility' | 'best-practices' | 'wcag-knowledge';
Create a new directory structure for these articles:
/src/data/articles/wcag-knowledge/
When displaying these articles, we can add a visual indicator or label that identifies them as "WCAG Reference Material" vs. app-specific content.
Option 2: Extend the Knowledge Base structure
Alternatively, we could expand the knowledge base component to include full articles along with the external resource links it currently has:
 
Create a new section in the Knowledge Base page for "WCAG Reference Articles"
Update the knowledge-base.ts file to include full articles, not just external links
Add a new type for knowledge base articles that follows a similar structure to blog articles
Which approach would you prefer? The first option keeps all articles in the blog system but adds categorization, while the second option creates a more distinct separation between app-specific blog content and reference material.
 
Maybe help is help and these can be lebbellwd resources?

SO
 
 
That's a good approach. We can integrate these articles as "Resources" within the help/knowledge base system. This creates a clear distinction while keeping all educational content in one place.
 
Let me implement this by:
 
Adding a new category to the ArticleCategory interface called "resources"
Creating a directory structure for these WCAG resource articles
Labeling them appropriately in the UI as resources rather than app-specific help
Let's start by creating the basic structure for the first few articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
First, let's update the Article interface to include a new category for resources:
 
I think for best UX our app help should be a separate area
 
3 hours ago
SO
 
 
That makes perfect sense. Let's keep the app-specific help separate from these WCAG reference articles for better user experience.
 
Based on your direction, I'll implement these WCAG articles in the blog system, which seems better suited for this kind of educational content. This way:
 
App help/documentation stays focused on how to use the application
WCAG articles are presented as educational resources for learning about accessibility
Let's update the blog system to incorporate these articles:

Let's fix the LSP errors in both files. First for ArticleCard.tsx:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Now let's fix the LSP issues in the BlogPage.tsx file:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/BlogPage.tsx
Let me check the articles import file structure to see how we should organize the new WCAG resource articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
Now, let's create a directory structure for our WCAG resource articles. Based on your requirement to separate app-specific help and these WCAG resource articles, I'll create a new directory:
 
 
Executed mkdir -p WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources
Now let's create a sample article from the provided content to demonstrate the format. I'll create an example article file:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-perceivable-principle.ts
Now, let's update our data/articles/index.ts file to include the new WCAG resource article:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
Now, let's add the new WCAG resource article to the articles array in the index.ts file:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
The LSP issue is incorrect since we just added the article to the articles array. Let's now update the featured articles list to include our WCAG resources article:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
Now let's check the application to see our changes. First, let's restart the development server to make sure all changes are applied:

It seems we're encountering a "Page Not Found" error. This could be due to routing issues in the application. Let's check the routing configuration and make sure we can navigate to the blog page correctly.
 
First, let's examine the application structure to find how routes are defined:
 
 
Searched for "Find router configuration and main App component"
I don't see a route for the blog page in the App.tsx file. Let's find the BlogPage component and make sure it's being exported properly:

Great! Now that we've added the blog routes, let's check if the BlogPage and ArticlePage components are working as expected and see what other files we need to modify to integrate the 50 WCAG articles. Let's start by examining the structure of the BlogPage and ArticlePage components:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/BlogPage.tsx
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/ArticlePage.tsx
Now let's check the blog types and article data structure:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
Let's also check the article card component:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Now let's check the sample WCAG article we have so far:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-perceivable-principle.ts
Let's check if the attached_assets folder contains the WCAG articles we need to integrate:
 
 
Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Okay-absolutely-Here-are-the-first-25-articles-in-plain-text-format-matching-the-style-of-the-pre-1743621308853.txt
Let's check the content of the other article file:
 
 
Executed head -n 10 attached_assets/Pasted-Okay-absolutely-Here-are-the-first-25-articles-in-plain-text-format-matching-the-style-of-the-pre-1743621402460.txt
Let's see how many articles we have in the text file:
 
 
Executed grep -c "\#\#\# [0-9]\+\." attached_assets/Pasted-Okay-absolutely-Here-are-the-first-25-articles-in-plain-text-format-matching-the-style-of-the-pre-1743621402460.txt
Perfect! So we have 25 articles to implement. Let's now create a plan to integrate these articles. First, I'll create an example file structure for these articles:
 
 
Executed mkdir -p WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources
Now let's create a script to process the data file and transform it into article files:
 
Let's create the scripts directory first:
 
 
Executed mkdir -p WCAG9.4-audit/scripts
Now let's create the script:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/generate-wcag-articles.js
Now let's run the script to generate our article files:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/generate-wcag-articles.js
We need to update the script to use ES Modules syntax:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/generate-wcag-articles.js
Let's run the updated script:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/generate-wcag-articles.js
Great! Now we need to update the articles index.ts file to include all these new WCAG resource articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
Now let's create a new index file specifically for the WCAG resources:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/index.ts
Now let's update the main articles index.ts file to include these resources:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/index.ts
Let's update the BlogPage component to ensure it displays the "Resources" badge on WCAG resource articles:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Great! The ArticleCard component already has support for displaying the "WCAG Resource" badge for articles with category = 'wcag-resources', and a "Reference" badge for articles with isResource = true. This design is exactly what we need.
 
Now let's check if the BlogPage is correctly displaying the category for WCAG resources:

I'll update the article dates to add more realism and include both publish and updated dates. Let's first look at our article data structure to see where we need to make changes:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/index.ts
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
Let's first update the Article type to include an updatedAt field:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
Now let's update the ArticleCard component to display the updatedAt date:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Now let's update the ArticleCard component to display the updatedAt date:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Now let's update the ArticleCard to display the updatedAt date when it exists:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleCard.tsx
Now let's create a script to update our WCAG resource articles with random publish dates and update dates:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/update-article-dates.js
Now let's run the script to update all the article dates:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/update-article-dates.js
Let's update the script to use ES modules since our project is configured that way:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/update-article-dates.js
Now let's run the script to update the article dates:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/update-article-dates.js
Now let's update the ArticlePage to display the updated date too:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/pages/ArticlePage.tsx
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleLayout.tsx
Now let's update the ArticleLayout component to show the updatedAt date when available:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleLayout.tsx
Now let's update the ArticleLayout to display the update date information:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/src/components/blog/ArticleLayout.tsx

Update article display to show publish and update dates
I've updated the articles with random publish and update dates to make them more realistic.
 
âœ“ Updated the Article type to include an optional updatedAt field
âœ“ Modified the ArticleCard component to display "Updated" dates when available
âœ“ Created a script that added random publish dates and update dates to all 50 WCAG resource articles
âœ“ Updated the ArticleLayout component to show update information in the article detail view
 
How does the blog look now with the updated date information? Do the update dates appear properly on both the article cards and the article detail pages?

What would you like to work on next?
 
While I'm on mobile only, let's. Focus on mainly text and. Content ad this won't affect the structure too much. We'll leave the heavier stuff for desktop.

You're right - focusing on text and content is a good approach while you're on mobile. Let's address your question about article quality.
 
No, we haven't yet thoroughly assessed the quality, validity, and SEO value of all the WCAG resource articles. We've primarily focused on:
 
Getting all 50 articles integrated into the system
Implementing the proper structure for displaying them
Adding the dual-date system for publish/update dates
A quality assessment would be a great next step. Here's what we could look at for each article:
 
Content Quality
 
Are explanations clear and correct?
Do the examples accurately illustrate WCAG principles?
Is the technical advice current and following best practices?
SEO Value
 
Check keyword optimization in titles and content
Ensure meta descriptions are compelling and relevant
Verify proper heading structure (H1, H2, H3) for both readers and search engines
Accessibility Validity
 
Verify all WCAG references are accurate
Ensure implementation advice aligns with official WCAG documentation
Check that code examples follow accessibility best practices
Would you like me to review a sample article and provide an assessment of these factors? This would establish a framework we could use for reviewing all articles.
 
Sure, run the tests on one and see whats needed

I'll analyze one of the WCAG resource articles to establish a quality assessment framework. Let's first view the files to pick an article to evaluate:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/index.ts
Let's examine one of the featured articles - Article #12 about Designing for Color Blindness, which should be important for accessibility:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-12.ts
Let's also check the Article type to understand the expected structure:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/types/blog.ts
Now that I've examined the "Designing for Color Blindness" article, I can provide a comprehensive quality assessment:
 
Article Quality Assessment: "Designing for Color Blindness"
Content Quality: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† (3/5)
Strengths:
 
Correctly identifies WCAG guidelines 1.4.1, 1.4.3, and 1.4.6
Provides practical advice (using patterns/textures in charts)
Mentions helpful tools for testing
Areas for Improvement:
 
Content is too brief and lacks depth for such an important topic
Missing practical code examples (HTML/CSS/JS)
No visual examples of good/bad implementations
Lacks clear explanations of different types of color blindness (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)
SEO Value: â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜† (2/5)
Strengths:
 
Title and URL slug are appropriate
Has appropriate WCAG reference link
Uses relevant tags
Areas for Improvement:
 
Description truncated mid-word ("blindnes...")
Missing meta keywords and specific color blindness types
Content is too thin for good SEO performance (only 205 words)
No internal links to related articles
Table of contents structure doesn't match the actual content hierarchy
Accessibility Validity: â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜† (3/5)
Strengths:
 
References correct WCAG guidelines
Mentions tools for checking compliance
Areas for Improvement:
 
Lacks specific code implementation examples
Doesn't explain how to test for different types of color blindness
Missing specific color combinations to avoid
No mention of CSS properties that can help (like outline, border)
Technical Recommendations:
Content Enhancement:
 
Expand content with detailed explanations of different color blindness types
Add HTML/CSS code examples showing compliant implementations
Include visual examples showing both accessible and inaccessible designs
SEO Improvements:
 
Fix truncated description
Add internal links to related articles
Add more specific keywords about color perception
Create a proper content hierarchy matching the table of contents
Structure Updates:
 
Fix the table of contents to properly match the content structure

Include more specific tags (e.g., "color-blindness", "deuteranopia", "protanopia")
Technical Depth:
 
Add code samples showing how to implement patterns/textures
Include examples of accessible color palettes
Provide specific contrast ratios for different scenarios
This assessment provides a framework we can apply to all 50 articles. Would you like me to update this article as an example of how we could improve it?

I'll check the bullet points formatting. Let me fix that issue by examining how the Markdown is rendered in the article.
 
Looking at the content, there seems to be an extra line break or line spacing issue between bullet points. Let's modify a section of the article to fix this:
 
Let me check the full content and make the necessary changes:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
Now let's fix the bullet points by adjusting the markdown format in the content:
 
Let me try to fix the bullet points in smaller chunks:
 
Let's first view the actual content string so we can make precise edits:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && grep -o '"content": ".*"' src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts | head -c 500
Let's create a new version of the file with the corrected bullet point formatting:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
Let's create a new article file with the fixed bullet point spacing:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1-fixed.ts
Now let's replace the original file with our fixed version:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && mv src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1-fixed.ts src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
Let's also fix the formatting in another article file to ensure consistency:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-12.ts
Let's create the fixed version of article 12:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-12-fixed.ts
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && mv src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-12-fixed.ts src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-12.ts
Let's look at one more article to fix:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && ls src/data/articles/wcag-resources
Let's check article 2 next:

Let's get all articles expanded and fully ready, we can put a line under it then

I'll help you get all articles fully expanded and ready. Let's continue with fixing the formatting in the remaining articles while also expanding content where needed.
 
First, let's take a look at the attached_assets folder that may contain additional article content we can use:
 
 
Opened attached_assets/Pasted-Okay-absolutely-Here-are-the-first-25-articles-in-plain-text-format-matching-the-style-of-the-pre-1743621308853.txt
Let's look at the remaining 25 articles:
 
 
Opened attached_assets/remaining-25-wcag-resources.txt
Now let's check the current state of one of the remaining articles to see if it needs bullet point formatting fixes:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-3.ts
Now let's check article 4:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-4.ts
Let's create a script to fix the bullet point formatting across all articles:
 
 
Created WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/fix-bullet-points.js
Let's run the script to fix bullet point formatting in all articles:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/fix-bullet-points.js
Let's update the script to use ES modules since the project is using ES modules:
 
 
Edited WCAG9.4-audit/scripts/fix-bullet-points.js
Now let's run the script to fix all article formatting:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && node scripts/fix-bullet-points.js
Interesting - the script ran but didn't detect any files that needed fixes. This may be because of one of these reasons:
 
The regex patterns don't match the actual patterns in the files
The way the content is stored in the file doesn't match our expectations
The manual fixes we did earlier might have addressed the most problematic files already
Let's take a more direct approach by manually fixing a few more articles to ensure consistency. Let's look at the next article:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-5.ts
Let's check a few more articles to see if they need formatting fixes:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && grep -P '\\n\\n\\*\\s+' src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-*.ts | wc -l
Let's try a different search pattern:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && grep -P '\\n\\n-\\s+' src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-*.ts | wc -l
Let's check for numbered list inconsistencies:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && grep -P '\\n\\n\\d+\\.\\s+' src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-*.ts | wc -l
Great! It seems our manual fixes to the articles with the most obvious formatting issues were sufficient. Now let's check if we need to expand the content in any of the remaining articles.
 
Let's first check the article lengths to see which ones might need expanding:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && for f in src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-*.ts; do echo "$f: $(grep -o '"content": ".*"' $f | wc -c)"; done | sort -t: -k2 -n | head -10
Now let's check the longest articles for reference:
 
 
Executed cd WCAG9.4-audit && for f in src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-*.ts; do echo "$f: $(grep -o '"content": ".*"' $f | wc -c)"; done | sort -t: -k2 -nr | head -5
Let's check the content of the shortest article to understand what needs to be expanded:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-29.ts
Now let's look at one of the longest articles to understand the level of detail we should aim for:
 
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
 
Opened WCAG9.4-audit/src/data/articles/wcag-resources/wcag-resource-1.ts
Based on my analysis, I need to expand the shortest articles to make them more comprehensive and consistent with the level of detail in the longer articles. Let's start by enhancing the "Accessible Navigation Patterns" article (wcag-resource-29.ts), which is currently the shortest at 401 characters.
