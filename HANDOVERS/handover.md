## Implementation Guidelines

### Core Principles
1. **Security First**: All implementations must follow security best practices
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
3. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase
4. **Non-destructive Changes**: Make incremental improvements without breaking existing functionality
5. **Documentation**: Document all key decisions and implementations

### Coding Patterns
1. **Error Handling**: Use the centralized error handler for consistent error management
2. **State Management**: Use React Query for remote state, context for global state
3. **Component Structure**: Follow a functional component approach with hooks
4. **Security**: Use security utilities for authentication, sanitization, and protection
5. **API Communication**: Use the apiClient for all API requests

### Critical Project Guidelines

1. **Non-Destructive Development**
   - Never delete or replace existing functional code
   - Build incrementally on top of existing work
   - Use feature toggles for major changes
   - Always maintain backward compatibility

2. **Security-First Approach**
   - All user inputs must be sanitized
   - Use secure storage for sensitive data
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization
   - Follow content security policy best practices
   - Rate limit all API endpoints

3. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content

4. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established directory structure
   - Use common/security/accessibility utility directories
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing
   - Document all public functions and components
   - Follow the error handling pattern with errorHandler.ts

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting
   - Implement proper memoization for expensive operations
   - Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately
   - Limit re-renders with proper component design
   - Implement progressive loading for large data sets

### April 20, 2025 - 12:40 AM EST

#### Accomplishments
- Refactored utility files into organized directories (common, security, accessibility, api)
- Created index.ts files in each directory for easier imports
- Consolidated duplicate utility files to eliminate redundancy
- Fixed import paths across the application to use the new directory structure
- Created LSP_ISSUES.md to track remaining TypeScript issues
- Created ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md for tracking a11y enhancements
- Created several key accessibility components:
  - SkipLink.tsx for keyboard navigation
  - FocusTrap.tsx for modal accessibility
  - HighContrastToggle.tsx for contrast preferences
- Implemented comprehensive accessibility testing utility with axe-core integration
- Added extensive high-contrast mode CSS for better visibility
- Fixed the testAccessibility function in the WCAG Checker page

#### Outstanding Issues
- Some TypeScript errors remain in utility files (tracked in LSP_ISSUES.md)
- Import path issues in some files (notably passwordPolicy.ts import in authApi.ts)
- Error handling parameter count mismatches in some utilities
- React-Helmet warnings still present in some components

#### Next Steps
1. Continue addressing the issues tracked in LSP_ISSUES.md
2. Implement more accessibility improvements from ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md
3. Fix error handling parameter count mismatches in utility functions
4. Enhance keyboard navigation across all interactive components
5. Add ARIA attributes to all interactive elements
6. Implement comprehensive testing for accessibility components

The project has made significant progress in improving code organization and accessibility features. The reorganized directory structure provides better maintainability, while the new accessibility components create a solid foundation for improving the accessibility score toward the 95/100 target.

The next agent should focus on implementing the items in ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md, particularly the keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes, as these will have the most significant impact on the accessibility score.
