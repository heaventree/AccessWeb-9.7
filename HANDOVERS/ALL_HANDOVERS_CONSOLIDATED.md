3. **Accessibility Requirements**
   - All components must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content

4. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established directory structure
   - Use common/security/accessibility utility directories
   - Implement proper TypeScript typing
   - Document all public functions and components
   - Follow the error handling pattern with errorHandler.ts
