# Archived Repositories

This directory contains archived repositories that served as disaster recovery backups for the main ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 project.

## Contents

1. **WCAG9.4-audit** - Disaster recovery backup of an earlier version of the accessibility audit tool
2. **WCAG9.4-audit-backup** - Secondary backup of the accessibility audit tool

## Archival Reason

These repositories were archived on April 19, 2025, as part of the Project Unification process. The ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 repository has been established as the single source of truth for the project, making these backup repositories redundant for active development.

## Access Notes

These repositories are maintained for historical reference and disaster recovery purposes only. They should not be used for active development. All new features, fixes, and improvements should be made in the ACCESS-WEB-V9.7 repository.

If access to these archived repositories is needed for any reason, please document the purpose and any files extracted for reference.
