# Project Introduction & Overview

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose
This blueprint defines a gold-standard architecture and process for building AI-first, multi-tenant, modular SaaS platforms and internal tools using modern technologies. It prioritizes code quality, accessibility, extensibility, and AI interoperability.

## 🔍 Scope & Objectives
- Guide AI and human developers in consistent project setup and structure.
- Define scalable technical foundations across frontend, backend, AI, and DevOps.
- Maintain compliance with WCAG, GDPR, security, and CI/CD standards.
- Enable seamless integration with automation platforms and third-party APIs.

## 💼 Target Users
- SaaS development teams
- Internal enterprise devops
- AI assistant platforms (Bolt, Cursor, etc.)
- White-label platform resellers

## 📐 Core Features
- Dynamic form engine with autosave and schema versioning
- AI-assisted onboarding, debugging, accessibility and UX tuning
- Self-healing architecture with rollback, snapshots, and error memory
- WCAG-safe theming and compliance automation
- Stripe Connect billing with multi-tier plans and client billing passthrough
- Headless backend (Fastify, Supabase, Prisma) + Vite-based frontend
