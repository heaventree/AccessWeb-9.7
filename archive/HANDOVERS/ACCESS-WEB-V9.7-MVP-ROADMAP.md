# MVP Accelerated Roadmap for ACCESS-WEB-V9.7

This document outlines a streamlined plan to reach MVP status quickly, focusing on the highest-priority items from the remediation strategy that are essential for a working product.

## Week 1: Critical Foundations (Days 1-7)

### Security Essentials
- ✅ Fix core error handling (errorHandler.ts) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement secure storage functionality - COMPLETED 
- ⏩ Implement basic JWT authentication with proper environment variables
- ⏩ Add CSP configurations for Stripe integration

### Core Functionality Verification
- ⏩ Create inventory of essential components needed for MVP
- ⏩ Verify all critical components are properly implemented
- ⏩ Identify and fix any remaining missing exports or functions

### WCAG Compliance Minimum
- ⏩ Implement basic accessibility testing for core UI components
- ⏩ Fix critical accessibility issues in main user flows
- ⏩ Test primary screens with screen readers

## Week 2: Usable Product (Days 8-14)

### User Authentication & Security
- ⏩ Complete user authentication flows
- ⏩ Implement password reset functionality
- ⏩ Add basic role-based authorization 

### Data Architecture
- ⏩ Implement core data models for projects and accessibility tests
- ⏩ Set up proper state management for key screens
- ⏩ Create data persistence layer

### Self-Compliance Testing
- ⏩ Run initial accessibility audit on the application itself
- ⏩ Fix highest-priority accessibility issues
- ⏩ Document compliance status

## Week 3: MVP Completion (Days 15-21)

### Testing & Stabilization
- ⏩ Implement critical path tests for core functionality
- ⏩ Fix reported bugs and issues
- ⏩ Test across supported browsers

### Documentation
- ⏩ Create user documentation for core features
- ⏩ Document API endpoints and integration points
- ⏩ Create handover documentation for future development

### Deployment
- ⏩ Set up production deployment pipeline
- ⏩ Configure monitoring and error reporting
- ⏩ Prepare for initial user testing

## Implementation Approach

To accelerate development:

1. **Parallel Workstreams:** Organize 2-3 team members to work simultaneously on:
   - Security & authentication
   - Core UI components & accessibility 
   - Data architecture & state management

2. **Daily Check-ins:** Have quick 15-minute meetings to identify blockers

3. **Focused Feature Set:** Limit scope to only what's needed for MVP:
   - User authentication
   - Project creation and management
   - Basic accessibility testing tools
   - Reporting functionality

4. **Incremental Testing:** Test features as they're completed rather than waiting

5. **Documentation-as-you-go:** Create minimal documentation during development

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Create a detailed component inventory document listing all essential components
2. Set up proper JWT authentication with environment variables
3. Fix remaining CSP issues for Stripe integration
4. Begin implementing basic accessibility testing for core UI components

## Development Guidelines

- Proceed carefully and incrementally with changes
- Test each change thoroughly before proceeding to the next task
- Maintain working UI at all times - no destructive changes
- Document all changes as they are implemented
- Focus on one component at a time
