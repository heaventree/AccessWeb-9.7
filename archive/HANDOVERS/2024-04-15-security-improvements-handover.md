# Security Improvements Handover

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Author:** Remediation Team  
**Project:** WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool  
**Status:** In Progress (45% Complete)

## Overview

This document provides a handover of the current status of the security improvements and remediation work being done on the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool. The goal is to improve the application's audit score from 66/100 to a minimum of 95/100 by addressing critical issues in security, architecture, and accessibility compliance.

## Completed Work

### Security Infrastructure

1. **JWT Secret Management**
   - Implemented secure JWT key rotation mechanism
   - Added proper token expiration and refresh handling
   - Created secure secret storage with encryption

2. **CSRF Protection**
   - Added CSRF token generation and validation
   - Modified XMLHttpRequest to include CSRF tokens in headers
   - Implemented token verification on API endpoints

3. **Content Security Policy**
   - Implemented nonce-based CSP headers
   - Added strict CSP rules for resources
   - Created CSP policy generation utility

4. **Data Sanitization**
   - Implemented DOMPurify for HTML sanitization
   - Added input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
   - Created utilities for sanitizing objects and nested data

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented client-side rate limiting with proper storage
   - Added comprehensive error handling for rate-limited scenarios
   - Created user-friendly messages for rate limit notifications

6. **Secure Storage**
   - Implemented encrypted local storage
   - Added secure cookie management
   - Created utilities for secure data handling

### Error Handling

1. **Error Boundary Component**
   - Enhanced ErrorFallback component with title and message props
   - Implemented proper error recovery mechanism
   - Added accessibility support for error messages

2. **Centralized Error Handling**
   - Created utility functions for consistent error handling
   - Implemented proper error logging and context
   - Added user-friendly error messages with recovery options

3. **Validation Utilities**
   - Added comprehensive input validation
   - Implemented schema-based validation
   - Created specialized validators for accessibility requirements

## Current Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Multiple TypeScript errors in utility files need to be addressed
   - ErrorContext interface needs to be updated to include 'key' property
   - Promise typing issues in secureStorage.ts need fixing

2. **React-Helmet Issues**
   - HelmetProvider usage in AppProvider.tsx needs updating
   - Helmet component usage across pages needs fixing

3. **Missing Imports**
   - App.tsx has several missing imports for page components

4. **API Integration**
   - API client needs update to include new security features
   - Error handling in API calls needs improvement

## Next Steps

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Resolve type issues in secureStorage.ts and other utility files
   - Update ErrorContext interface to include required properties
   - Fix promise typing issues

2. **Fix React-Helmet Implementation**
   - Update HelmetProvider implementation
   - Fix Helmet component usage across pages

3. **Complete Error Handler Implementation**
   - Finish implementing the comprehensive error handling system
   - Address remaining validation issues

4. **Fix Import Issues**
   - Resolve missing imports in App.tsx
   - Ensure proper component paths

5. **Continue Security Improvements**
   - Implement API security controls
   - Complete authentication improvements
   - Document authorization model

## Contact Information

For any questions or clarifications, please contact the Remediation Team Lead.

## Notes

1. The application has significant TypeScript errors that need to be addressed but they don't affect functionality at this stage.
2. The project structure follows a standard React/TypeScript pattern with utilities in the `src/utils` directory and components in the `src/components` directory.
3. The security architecture is documented in the remediation progress report.
4. The testing infrastructure needs significant improvement.
