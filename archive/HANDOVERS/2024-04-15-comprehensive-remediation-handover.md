2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Multiple TypeScript errors in utility files
   - ErrorContext interface needs to be updated to include 'key' property
   - Promise typing issues in secureStorage.ts

3. **React-Helmet Issues**
   - HelmetProvider usage in AppProvider.tsx needs updating

### 4.2 Non-Critical Issues (Medium Priority)

1. **Unused Variables**
   - Several declared but never read variables
   - SALT_LENGTH, ITERATION_COUNT, reportOnly, etc.

2. **Argument Count Mismatches**
   - Multiple functions are called with too many arguments
   - Errors in auth.ts, rateLimiting.ts, validation.ts

3. **Type Inconsistencies**

   - String vs HTMLElement type conflicts in sanitization.ts

### 4.3 Known Limitations

1. **Incomplete API Security**
   - API security controls are not fully implemented
   - API request validation is partial

2. **Partial User Session Management**
   - Token revocation is not implemented

## 6. Tips and Warnings

### 6.1 Important Tips

1. **ErrorContext Interface**
   - When updating the ErrorContext interface, add the 'key' property but ensure backward compatibility
   - Check all error handling utilities to ensure they accommodate the updated interface

2. **React-Helmet Fix**
   - The react-helmet-async library may need a different import/usage pattern
   - Check for compatibility issues with React 18+
   - Consider using the updated Context API approach from react-helmet-async documentation

3. **Promise Typing**
   - For promise typing issues, ensure proper Promise<T> typing throughout
   - Use async/await consistently for promise handling

### 6.2 Potential Pitfalls

1. **Sanitization Export Fix**
   - When adding the sanitizeObject export, make sure it's properly implemented and tested
   - Check for any other missing exports that might cause similar issues

2. **Helmet Provider Implementation**
   - Be cautious when modifying the HelmetProvider implementation
   - Changes might affect security headers delivery
   - Test thoroughly after changes

3. **Error Context Updates**
   - Modifying the ErrorContext interface might affect existing error handling
   - Ensure all error throwing code accommodates the updated interface

### 6.3 Testing Recommendations

1. **JWT Authentication Testing**
   - Test token generation, validation, and refresh flow
   - Verify key rotation works as expected
   - Check token expiration handling

2. **CSRF Protection Testing**
   - Test token generation and validation
   - Verify XMLHttpRequest modifications work correctly
   - Check same-origin enforcement

3. **Rate Limiting Testing**
   - Test limit enforcement

   - Check progressive backoff functionality

4. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test error boundaries with different error types
   - Verify error recovery mechanisms
   - Check accessibility of error messages

## 8. Conclusion

The remediation effort has made significant progress, with current estimated score improvement from 35/100 to 72/100. The implementation of robust security features and enhanced error handling has substantially improved the application's security posture and user experience.

The next phase should focus on fixing the immediate issues (missing exports, TypeScript errors, and React-Helmet implementation), followed by enhancing API security, improving user session management, and completing the security testing framework.

With the current trajectory and planned improvements, we are on track to meet or exceed the target score of 95/100.
