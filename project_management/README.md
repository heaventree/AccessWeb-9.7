- Architecture documentation and system design
- Development guidelines and best practices
- API specifications and integration guides
- Security and compliance standards
- WordPress and third-party integration documentation

### Project Updates

## How to Use This System

1. **For Developers:**
   - Review `PLANNING.md` to understand the project's vision and technical architecture
   - Check `TASK.md` for your assigned tasks and their status
   - Reference technical documentation in the `/technical` directory
   - Add any issues encountered to `ISSUES.md`
   - Document completed work in `CHANGELOG.md`

2. **For Project Managers:**
   - Use `ROADMAP.md` to track overall project progress
   - Update `TASK.md` with new tasks and prioritize the backlog
   - Review `/updates` for milestone achievements and project status
   - Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` for customer-facing release notes

3. **For AI Agents:**
   - Reference `project.index.json` for machine-readable project structure
   - Follow the guidelines in `AI_AGENT_GUIDELINES.md` for development standards
   - Adhere to the project architecture defined in `PLANNING.md`
   - Document changes according to the Conventional Commits standard

## Integration with Development Processes

This management system integrates with:

1. **Version Control**: 
   - Commit messages should reference task IDs (e.g., "feat(access): Implement color contrast checker #PM-123")
   - Pull Requests should link to tasks they complete

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated tests verify WCAG compliance of our own components
   - Build status is reflected in task updates

3. **Documentation**:
   - Technical documentation in the `/technical` directory is updated as tasks are completed
   - User-facing documentation reflects completed roadmap items

## Accessibility Standards

As an accessibility tool, our own project adheres to:
- WCAG 2.2 AA+ standard compliance
- Color-blind safe design patterns
- Full keyboard navigation support
- Proper ARIA attributes and screen reader compatibility
- Inclusive design principles throughout all components
