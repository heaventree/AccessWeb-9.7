# Assessment Scoring Matrix

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** Active  
**Owner:** Assessment Team  

## Overview

This document provides a standardized scoring matrix for evaluating the effectiveness of remediation efforts across all critical areas identified in the Senior Code Audit Report. The matrix enables objective measurement of progress and helps identify areas requiring additional focus.

## Scoring Methodology

Each assessment area is evaluated across five quality dimensions:

1. **Completeness:** The extent to which all required elements are present (1-5)
2. **Accuracy:** The correctness and precision of implementation (1-5)
3. **Consistency:** The uniformity and coherence of implementation (1-5)
4. **Usability:** The ease of use and accessibility of implementation (1-5)
5. **Maintainability:** The ease with which the implementation can be maintained (1-5)

**Maturity Levels:**
- Level 0: Not Present (0%)
- Level 1: Initial/Ad Hoc (1-20%)
- Level 2: Repeatable (21-40%)
- Level 3: Defined (41-60%)
- Level 4: Managed (61-80%)
- Level 5: Optimized (81-100%)
