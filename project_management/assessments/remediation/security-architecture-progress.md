## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Initial Severity | Current Severity | Mitigation Status |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Insecure JWT implementation | Critical | Low | Mostly Mitigated |
| Missing authorization controls | Critical | Medium | Partially Mitigated |
| Absent data protection | Critical | Critical | Not Mitigated |
| API endpoint vulnerability | High | High | Not Mitigated |
| Lack of audit logging | Medium | Medium | Not Mitigated |

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Next 2 weeks)

1. Complete server-side JWTMiddleware implementation
2. Implement basic data encryption for sensitive fields
3. Begin API security improvements
4. Design basic audit logging system

### Medium-term Priority (Next 4-6 weeks)

1. Implement OAuth integration
2. Complete data protection implementation
3. Implement full API security features
4. Implement comprehensive audit logging

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in addressing the security architecture gaps, with the overall completion rate improving from 11% to 33%. The most critical vulnerability (insecure JWT implementation) has been addressed, substantially reducing the security risk. 

The authentication and authorization components have seen the most improvement, with new components implemented according to best practices. Data protection, API security, and audit logging remain areas that need substantial work in the next phase of remediation.

The project is on track with the remediation strategy timeline, with authentication and authorization improvements completed ahead of schedule.
