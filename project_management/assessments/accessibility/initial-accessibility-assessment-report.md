# Initial Accessibility Self-Assessment Report

**Date:** April 15, 2024  
**Status:** Initial Assessment  
**Owner:** Accessibility Assessment Team  

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of the initial accessibility self-assessment of the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool conducted between April 10-15, 2024. The assessment evaluated the application against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards using a combination of automated testing, manual review, and assistive technology testing.

### Overall Compliance Status

Based on our assessment, the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool currently **fails to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** requirements. While the tool is designed to help others achieve accessibility compliance, our assessment reveals that the tool itself has significant accessibility issues that need to be addressed.

### Key Findings

1. **Critical Issues (P0):** 7 issues that block essential functionality for users with disabilities
2. **High Priority Issues (P1):** 12 issues that seriously impact usability
3. **Medium Priority Issues (P2):** 18 issues that cause difficulty but have workarounds
4. **Low Priority Issues (P3):** 9 issues with minimal impact

### Critical Issues Summary

1. Keyboard traps in modal dialogs prevent keyboard users from accessing or dismissing modals
2. Screen reader users cannot access the audit results due to improper ARIA implementation
3. Form error messages are not programmatically associated with form fields
4. Color contrast fails in multiple critical interface elements
5. Focus management is broken during dynamic content updates
6. No alternative for drag-and-drop file upload functionality
7. Navigation menu cannot be operated by keyboard alone

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Remediation (1-2 weeks):**
   - Fix keyboard traps in modal dialogs
   - Fix screen reader access to audit results
   - Associate error messages with form fields
   - Implement keyboard alternatives for drag-and-drop

2. **Short-term Improvements (1-2 months):**
   - Fix all contrast issues
   - Implement proper focus management
   - Make navigation fully keyboard accessible
   - Fix ARIA implementation issues

3. **Longer-term Strategy (2-3 months):**
   - Implement component-level accessibility testing
   - Integrate automated accessibility testing into CI/CD
   - Develop accessibility testing plan for new features
   - Conduct regular reassessments

## Conclusion

The initial accessibility assessment of the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool reveals significant accessibility issues that must be addressed for the tool to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. The irony of an accessibility audit tool failing to meet accessibility standards underscores the importance of "eating our own dog food" and ensuring that our commitment to accessibility is reflected in our own products.

The critical issues identified in this assessment present substantial barriers for users with disabilities, particularly keyboard-only users and screen reader users. The proposed remediation plan outlines a path to address these issues in a prioritized manner, with immediate focus on the most critical barriers.

By implementing this remediation plan and integrating accessibility testing into our development process, we can transform the WCAG Accessibility Audit Tool into a exemplar of accessible design, reinforcing our commitment to digital inclusion and enhancing our credibility in the accessibility space.
